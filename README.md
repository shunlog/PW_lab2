## About nnn

> nnn (nÂ³) is a full-featured terminal file manager. It's tiny, nearly 0-config and incredibly fast.
> 
> It is designed to be unobtrusive with smart workflows to match the trains of thought.
>
> nnn can analyze disk usage, batch rename, launch apps and pick files. The plugin repository has tons of plugins to extend the capabilities further e.g. live previews, (un)mount disks, find & list, file/dir diff, upload files. A patch framework hosts sizable user-submitted patches which are subjective in nature.
